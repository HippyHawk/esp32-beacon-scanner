Beacon scanner for ESP32
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcaelers/esp32-beacon-scanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcaelers/esp32-beacon-scanner)

A BLE scanner application for ESP32 that publishes all detected BLE devices using MQTT.

The ultimate goal of the project is server-side indoor positioning using multiple ESP32 devices that detect beacons.

NOTE: This is work in progress.
