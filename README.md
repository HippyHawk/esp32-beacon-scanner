Beacon scanner for ESP32
================================

An bBeacon scanner application for ESP32 that publishes all detected beacons using MQTT.

The ultimate goal of the project is server-side indoor positioning using multiple ESP32 devices that detect beacons.

NOTE: This is work in progress. The C++ ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS abstraction will eventually be moved to a separate repository. 

NOTE: You need a recent version of ESP-IDF from the master branch of https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf. The latest released version (2.1) is not supported.
